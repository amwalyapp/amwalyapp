      If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use
      of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I
      collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or

      The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our

      For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to

      information that I request will be retained on your device and is not
      collected by me in any way.
    </p>
    <!---->
    <strong>Log Data</strong>
    <p>
      I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an
      error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party
      products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include
      information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device
      name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when
      utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and
      other statistics.
    </p>
    <strong>Cookies</strong>
    <p>
      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
      anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the
      websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may
      use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect
      information and improve their services. You have the option to either
      accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to
      your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to
      use some portions of this Service.
    </p>
    <strong>Service Providers</strong>
    <p>
      I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following
      reasons:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc">
      <li>facilitate our Service;</li>
      <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
      <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
      <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have
      access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
      assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
      disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <strong>Security</strong>
    <p>
      I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are
      striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But
      remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
      electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>
    <strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>
    <p>
      This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
      third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
      external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
      review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and
      assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices

        I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
        children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally
        identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. I
        encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's
        Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
        children never to provide personally identifiable information through
        the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have
        reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable
        information to us through the Application and/or Services, please
        contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the
        processing of your personally identifiable information in your country
